# Apple Encrypted Archive Tool
Apple Encrypted Archive (AEA) is a proprietary archive format that supports compression, encryption and signatures. It is designed such that the decoding of large files can be parallelized across threads.

Eventually, this repository aims to provide the following features:
* An open source command line tool with the same interface as the official [aea](https://manpagehub.com/aea) tool.
* A Python library to work with AEA files in code.
* Documentation that describes the AEA file format.

Currently, only partial documentation of the file format is available.

### Documentation
