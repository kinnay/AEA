# Apple Encrypted Archive Tool
Apple Encrypted Archive (AEA) is a proprietary archive format that supports compression, encryption and signatures. It is designed such that the decoding of large files can be parallelized across threads.

Currently, this repository provides:
* A Python library to work with AEA files in code.
* Documentation that describes the AEA file format.

Eventually, it also aims to provide:
* An open source command line tool with the same interface as the official [aea](https://manpagehub.com/aea) tool.

### Documentation
